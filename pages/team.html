                    <p>The inventor of the original "Salamander drop shot" technique. superTROOPER95 is a passionate
                        gamer who has sunk over 2000 hours into the Destiny series and
                        can retell the entirety of the rich Destiny lore to anyone who cares enough to listen.
                        superTROOPER95 will be the first to inform his team members of the latest video game industry
                        news as he looks forward to the teams regular Wednesday night gaming session. Where the team

                    <p>Formely known as rooboy0490, Lord Muk is the oldest member of the team and with age
                        comes wisdom. With the longest history with video games amongst anyone in the team. Lord Muk has
                        gone from conquering Zelda games in his childhood on the Nintendo 64 to slaying the most
                        difficult bosses in games such as Elden Ring. During multiplayer games Lord Muk is generally
                        a competent team member despite the occasional over estimation in his ability which prompts his

                    <h2>Flam1ng N1nja</h2>
                    <p>All great teams have humble beginnings. One of the earliest unions of team members was between
                        Flam1ng N1nja and superTROOPER95 when Flam1ng N1nja snuck into superTROOPER95's DMs asking to
                        play a
                        game of Modern Warfare 2. The power duo has gone on to dominate many Halo and Call of Duty
                        lobbies over the
                        years.
                        Outside of seducing teenage boys,
                        Flam1ng N1nja is a grizzled Halo player who possessed the
                        infamous and coveted gamertag "Flaming Ninja"... until he forgot his password.

                    <h2>Menisel</h2>
                    <p>When there is a game that offers a health gain mechanic you can be sure that Menisel will be
                        along
                        for the ride. Menisel will always be the first to raise his hand to take up the role as healer.
                        Nothing
                        gives the man more satisfaction than healing a fellow team member from 1HP to full health. After
                        overcoming a debilitating World of Warcraft addiction in the 2000's, Menisel has established
                        himself
                        as a Call of Duty veteran sinking countless hours into the long running series.

                    <h2>turtlesak</h2>
                    <p>Arguably the most passionate member of the team. Turtlesak self identifies as a deadeye with what
                        ever the current Call of Duty meta is. With claims of victory when nobody else is around to see.
                        Curious
                        that isn't it? Turtlesak's lineage dates back to his teenage years where he and Menisel
                        purchased an Xbox
                        360 in
                        secret and had to hide it away from his parents. Playing Halo 3: ODST Firefight at odd hours in
                        the evening just to sneak in a session. Then
                        unplugging
                        and
                        hiding the console away so that his parents wouldn't find out.

                        turtlesak to countless Warzone victories. During the COVID-19 2020 lockdown, Xavbeks was a
                        critical part of Team Salamanders but his recent betrayal in moving to PlayStation coupled with
                        Sony's incompetencies surrounding Cross Play has raised some turmoil within the team.

                    <h2>Ketameme</h2>
                    <p>Ketameme is the newest member of the team. He is a man with a need for speed, you'll typically
                        find
                        him tearing it up in the latest game from the Forumla 1 series. He also has a large number of
                        hours
                        accumulated in Mario Kart 8, where he is lethal on all of the "Big 4" circuits (except for Toad
                        Habour).
                        While his performance in Mario Kart can be questionable at times. Since the launch of Halo
                        Infinite, Ketameme has stepped outside his comfort zone of playing sport and racing games and
                        has greatly improved his
                        first-person shooter skills. Even stepping into GTA V Online where he attends his Marijuana
